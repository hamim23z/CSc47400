Task <br>
In this problem I want you to think about different data set types. 
Find an example of a visualization (image) of each of these data types <br>
1D Time Series <br>
2D Scaler Field <br>
3D Scaler Field <br>
2D Vector Field <br>
3D Shape <br>
Graph (not tree)

<br>

Requirement <br>
First collect (download) the images you find. 
Just to make this a double challenge, you will make this as an ipython slideshow. 
You will use the commands to display in images within your ipython notebook as "results".
“from IPython.display import display, Image” 
display(Image(filename=’misc-you-dont-say-l.png’)) 
Next watch this: https://mljar.com/blog/jupyter-notebook-presentation/ and figure out how to make slides with your ipython notbook and export them to html/js slideshow in your repo.
With each of the 6 examples you should have a short explanation of how this is a visualization of the data (what is the data and how it is this data type).
